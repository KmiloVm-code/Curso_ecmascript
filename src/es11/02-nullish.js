// declare anotherNumber variable and assign null value to it
const anotherNumber = null;

/* declare validate variable and use the nullish coalescing operator to check if anotherNumber is null or undefined. 
If it is, then assign 5 to the variable validate
*/
const validate = anotherNumber ?? 5;

// output validate to the console
console.log(validate);

/* 
The above example demonstrates the use of the nullish coallescing operator (??) in javascript. 
The nullish coallescing operator returns the left-hand side operand if it is not null or undefined, 
otherwise it returns the right-hand side operand.

In the code above, the value of the 'anotherNumber' variable is null. 
When we use the nullish coallescing operator, we check if this value is null or undefined, which it is. 
Therefore, the value of 5 is assigned to the 'validate' variable.

Finally, we output the value of 'validate' to the console, which is 5.
